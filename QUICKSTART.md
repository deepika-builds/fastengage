## Keyboard Shortcuts (Coming Soon)

Currently, you need to click the "Draft" button, but keyboard shortcuts are planned for v0.2.0.

## Troubleshooting

**"Draft" button not showing?**
- Refresh the page
- Make sure you're on a supported platform
- Check that the extension is enabled

**"API key not configured" error?**
- Go to Settings and add your OpenAI API key
- Make sure you clicked "Save Settings"

**Generation is slow?**
- Normal range is 3-5 seconds
- Check your internet connection
- OpenAI API might be experiencing high traffic

**Replies sound generic?**
- Add more voice rules in Settings
- Add more example replies
- Increase the boldness level
- Make your authority themes more specific

## Cost Estimate

Using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini:
- Each generation costs ~$0.001 (one-tenth of a cent)
- 100 replies = ~$0.10
- 1000 replies = ~$1.00

Very affordable for regular use!
